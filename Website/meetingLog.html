          was actually a huge surprise considering the whirlwind that was yesterday) except for the fact that Nami

          Jake had the idea to make a different puzzle with a keypad that will allow the players to increase
          the amount of game time that they are allotted. There will be math equations spread throughout the room
          and if they players input those into a special keypad box they can get more time! The combos for the keypad have
          been included below as well as Kyles contraption to let us open the auto boxes with only one 12 volt
          power supply. Safety third, children!

          WE FOUND A SECOND CRT!! This is so exciting, Kyle is going to pick it up tomorrow morning,
          but now we dont have to use our professors monitors at all! Plus, this one has a speaker, so
          we can just use the audio from that instead of trying to hook up bluetooth speakers. So awesome!
          Kyle also made some ID badges for us to wear on demo day and he printed some enclosures for the 
          motion sensors so that people can actually be seen by the monster. Were making good progress, but we
          REALLY need to do a dry run!

                Have you ever done an escape room? (For the sake of this example we are going to say that the person asking
                doesn't know what an escape room is) That's okay! Essentially, an escape room is an interactive puzzle
                experience where you are “trapped” in a room until you are successfully able to solve all of the puzzles and
                escape. Normally, the puzzles used in escape rooms require physical contact with the object that you are
                trying to open: a combination puzzle, a lock and key, or a cabinet or drawer of some kind. What makes our
                escape room unique is that all of the modules can communicate with each other over WiFi. This allows us to
                place puzzles physically distanced from the boxes that they open, have certain events trigger changes in
                multiple devices at the same time, or even give hints dynamically based on which puzzles have already been
                solved without having to actually speak to the participants in the room.
              </p>

              <p>
                Many of the puzzles that we have in our room have been created ourselves using Arduinos and our own
                electronics. Some examples are a puzzle that requires you to correctly position four potentiometers, a safe
                dial that requires a correct combination to open, and two RCA plugboards that you have to connect using the
                correct cables. As mentioned before, all of these puzzles can communicate with each other over WiFi, which
                allows them to tell other components if they have been solved, how much time is left in the escape room, and
                what state the room is in. Making a wide variety of puzzles gave us the opportunity to write code in a
                variety of languages, work with lots of different physical circuits, and figure out how to connect them all.
                Our project focused more on the wide variety of areas that are included in Computer Engineering rather than
                diving deep into one or two of them.
              </p>

              <p>
                Another fun detail about escape rooms is that most of them are tightly coupled to a theme of some sort. For
                example, some rooms set up the escape as some sort of escape from prison, while others just help the players
                recount some sort of mystery while inside. Our escape room is designed around analog horror, specifically
                the event of Y2K and how many people feared the collapse of computer systems as they transitioned from 1999
                to 2000. We have done our own voice acting and recorded them to cassette tapes to help make the room feel
                more immersive. This is what players will receive as they enter the room. It is a classified note from one
                of the scientists about the experiments that they have been running in the room and a tape recording that
                players will place into a tape player to learn about their first hint and the predicament that they have
                found themselves in. We are really proud of our room and hope you are able to escape! Do you have any
                questions?

          Today we presented a progress report on how far we've gotten along this project! Kyle 3D printed the bust that
          Nami designed and it looks great! Kyle also 3D printed frames for the potentiometer puzzle and designed one
          for the dial puzzle as well. He has also written a first draft for the memorandum we have given to the players
          that is an optional reading for tips and world building. Nami has gotten a converter that will allow us to
          convert HDMI to RCA and connect our mini PC to the old CRT TV we have! He has also gotten stickers that will
          tell players which objects are not a part of the escape room and speakers that will play stereophonic sound
          and ambience. Jake has gotten the box PCBs to work, wrote up a first draft for our pitch, and has gotten the

          further work, we can get this to work wirelessly with an ESP module. He has also finished the model of the
          bust using the 3D scan we have gotten earlier for a future puzzle. Jake got a rotary encoder for the clock

          Happy Halloween! Kyle is sick again, though after some talk about a rotating wire puzzle, he has begun
          prototyping a potentiometer puzzle that will be cool and easy to implement. Nami with the mini PC figured out
          a way to use the python-vlc plugin to play videos whenever we desire. Nami has also edited and uploaded a ton
          of videos that can be played on the CRT monitors that will achieve tons of atmosphere for the game. Jake got

          Big moves made over the last week! Kyle has printed more servo mounts that fit really well onto the motors. He
          has also got a way for us to play through speakers using an MJduino alongside printing out a frame for the RCA
          puzzle! Nami decided to look into 3D scanning to create a bust of one of the players for the room. Initially
          he tried to use a phone app but it had some holes in the final model, so instead we went to the Marriot
          Library's 3D printing and scanning services to get a great model (although it still needs to be cleaned up a
          bit before printing)! Jake found a way to get a clock reset mechanism going with slot interrupters that will
          allow us to keep track of the start and end of the game cycle (1 PM - 12 AM). He showed this off on a video
          (on a paper plate 😆)! Jake also added a dial puzzle and got it to work consistently.

          Kyle has created code to have a solenoid and servo fire at the push of a button, which will be used for the

          This week we reintroduced our project in a presentation alongside delivering a project plan for the rest of
          the semester. Kyle has printed out mounts for the motor to create the latch, but will need a little bit of
          revising to fit perfectly. Nami finished code for a stepper motor to tick for the clock and Jake has made even
          more progress on the communication with ESP modules and now they communicate (though still needs some cleaning
          up)!

          some boxes, but we didn't really work on our senior project during the summer. This meeting was to help us
          catch up with each other and so that we were aware of what everyone else was going to be working on. Kyle is
          going to be doing some hardware work to try and get some relays working for the solenoids, Jake is working on
          the wireless connectivity portion, and Nami is going to start trying to get an encoded stepper motor working

          Our meeting today was mostly about the project proposal and what we were hoping to demonstrate to the class
          on demo day. For this demo, we are hoping to display a working clock that, when either a "fast forward"
          button or a "reverse" button are pressed, the clock will spin accordingly. Furthermore, we would like to have
          a terminal that shows what time our clock is currently set to so the computer knows what time it is.
          This functionality is central to our project, and getting this done early will give us a jump-start for
          our final senior project.

          escape room on Saturday so we can have a better idea as to what kinds of puzzles would be feasable

          this is the clock pertaining to the actual story of the experience). On this topic, we also discussed a few
