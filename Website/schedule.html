            <p class="readable-font indent-text">For september we are hoping to finalize which puzzles we are hoping to
                use in the room and actually
                build/connect/integrate them. This includes getting the clock to tick properly, get the latches for the
                boxes working as they should, and connect all of the components using a Wi-Fi network system. The
                components should also report back to the main system that they have been completed. We are also hoping
                to start work on the experiental aspect of the escape room.

            <p class="readable-font indent-text">
                Since Halloween is in October we are going to be focusing on the horror aspect of the escape room! Just
                kidding, it's not because Halloween is in October, but it does line up nicely. During October we are
                going to focus heavily on how the room is going to play out and what we are hoping the player will feel
                while they are in the room. That will include lighting, spooky sounds, and further development of the
                story. We are also going to focus on getting more puzzles developed for the room and we are going to
                integrate them into the connected system that we developed in September.

            <p class="readable-font indent-text">
                By November we are hoping to have a lot of the room completed. We are still going to be adding things
                and pushing to reach our stretch goals, however, November is going to be utilized to test the room,
                flush out bugs, and prepare anything else that we may need in order to be fully ready for Demo day.

            <p class="readable-font indent-text">
                December, although not very long in terms of the semester, is going to be vitally important. This is the
                month that we are actually planning on showcasing our room and allowing people to play it on demo day!
                There may still be a few little bugs or stretch goals that we are working on during December, but it
                will mostly be used to meditate and reflect on how Demo day is going to go. And to play the room!
